  Version History:
    0.1.0   12/21/15 - Conversion from the c++ version. First versioned copy
                       anywhere.
                     - Primarily about laying out the data structures and the
                       very top of top-down design at this point.
                     - Compiles, runs.
    0.2.0   12/31/15 - Continued work.
                     - Added supporting files/code.
    0.3.0     1/1/16 - First pass parsing (mostly) complete.
                     - Second pass parsing (partially) complete.
                     - Command line options roughed out (but not implemented).
 --------------------- Items merged in from parallel effort
 PREMERGE.1  1/22/16 - First versioned release
 PREMERGE.2  1/26/16 - Cloned from github.com
 --------------------- END
    0.4.0    1/26/16 - The merge, updates to this file
    0.5.0    1/28/16 - Making the bp part of the Makefile 'dominate' after
                       the merge. Merging some of the make build dependencies
                       and formatting.
                     - Added in the options.code (still somewhat minimalistic).
                     - Pulled the support.h/c from the code.
                     - Options parsing now supports the basic switch input
                       and setting the config file executable / magic option.
                     - Integrated (minimally) the enum parsing code.
                     - grep $TUB * | wc -l ----> 80
    0.6.0    1/29/16 - Enum parsing integration is largely complete.
                     - Moved in the Entity parsing. Integration requires a
                       bit of refactoring of code. It is cleaner, but my
                       scalpel looks more like a hatchet.
                     - Where I am: The Entity parsing has been moved into
                       get_parse_point(). Second pass needs to be modified
                       for this new structure / method.
                     - grep $TUB * | wc -l ----> 78
    0.7.0     2/1/16 - Picked an author.
                     - Moved file operations out of bpfparse.c to slfile.h/c.
                       This was because I wanted file parsing in options.c
                       and wanted to use the same "helper" functionality.
                       Find additional commentary in slfile.h.
                     - Started on file-based options parsing.
                     - Wrote a BNF-ish ruleset for the BPF file format.
                     - Started work on cleanup of get_parse_point().

#define VERSION_STRING "0.7.0"

  Notes:
    - Just wanted to capture this somewhere. I thought it up and think I should
      use it from now on out. It is:
      When completing a simple STUB comment, the STUB text should be removed
      and the comment should remain as a clear denotation of where we are
      doing. When completing a design choice with a block of commentary, then
      the STUB strings should be converted to RESOLVED, CHOSEN & REJECTED tags.

  ToDo:                                                                      !
   [ ] The options parsed in the BPF file override those set on the command
       line. This is reverse of what it *should* be. (Note: At the time of
       this writing, command-line options are not allowed when setting your
       BPF file executable and using file magic to get your bp interperter.)
   [ ] The calls to ParseEntity() inside get_parse_point() do not have the
       line numbers passed, nor do they have proper exception handling.
   [ ] The copy_out_nth_token() code (most likely) does not properly parse
       (mete out) the tokens. Add the proposed algo to fix this.
   [ ] Offset can be 0, but size cannot. This should be validated during one
       of the passes. Probably during the final pass.
   [ ] When ParsePoints are added, the tag identifiers must be compared to
       insure that they are unique. Tag name collisions are not allowed.
   [ ] Will you support "defined"/set values. For example:
       settag hdroffset 16
       This would create a tag called hdroffset that is a hard-set value of
       16 (decimal).
       Notes on this issue:
       1. The "settag" operator is inconsistent with how enums are set.
       2. A line beginning with a tagXXX (the enumXXX = method) will be
          indiscernable from parse point lines that can begin with that
          same tag (in the offset field).
       3. "settag" and "setenum" operators seem to make the most sense, and
          are consistent (with each other).
   [ ] Write the must= clause support.
   [Q] pmath "5 6" passes, it should not. Perhaps it should. It sees 5<space>
       and considers 5 a valid number. The 6 would be parsed as a different
       entity / token on the line and fail there. I will keep this here
       until that is tested. But parsing $(pmath "5 6") into 5 is appropriate. 
   [ ] Eliminate redundant error messages. Make parsing errors consistent
       across all fail points.
   [_] Write parser for (in-bpf-file) command line options. Such as:
       setopt c         <---- Same as -c
       setopt x myarg   <---- Same as -x myarg
   [ ] Create more sample.bpf files - perhaps they should be part of the test
       suite.
   [ ] Setup 3-dot truncation for strings used in error messages. DO NOT
       OVERFLOW THE LINE!
   [ ] No documentation of struct members or ParseOptions() in options.h.
   [ ] Some functions in strlib.h are not documented.
   [ ] The datapoint.* code probably needs to go. It was part of the original
       C++ design.
   [ ] Start working the $stubs throught the code. Currently at 80 across the
       entire project. Clear this todo when it is <= 40.
   [ ] Enum parsing in bpfparse.c::ParseBPFFile() needs to handle the $tubs
       dealing with return values from ParseEnum() as well as changes to 
       ParseEnum() itself in terms of input.
   [ ] Technically.... You should be able to call the executable bpf file with
       command line options thusly: ./mybpf -c mybin
       This means that the args would be:
        argv[1] = "./mybpf"
        argv[2] = "-c"
        argv[3] = "mybin"
       From that, we see the need to parse command line options "out of
       order" so to speak. This means that they are incompatible with the
       getopt() API (as intended - possibly we could advance the pointer
       when we hit a word/non-dash argument).
   [_] Pull out all references to support.c. This was always a temp file that
       would be covered by the proper functions in strlib.h/c.
   [ ] options.c::ParseOptions() should validate the options before returning.
   [ ] The help output has a few different output methods. These are not
       covered in the options struct (with appropriate flags), nor is the
       help output clear on what the options mean. (Specifically: The output
       needs to relate that this option modifies the output format.)
   [ ] Consider removing all the validate_* code in pmath.c. This should all
       be doable in a single pass. Drop the naieve approach and move on. It is
       incorrect to have parsing rules in two different places.
   [ ] Remove the remaining support_c/h.txt files from the project.
   [ ] Remove all unnessary (redundant) error message handling.
   [ ] Hide all the debug messages behind pre-processor directives.
   [ ] Resolve the "assert() $TUB" in bpfparse.c::ResolveTags().
   [ ] Make the location of the function description comment consistent.
       Consider creating function comment blocks for *all* functions.
   [ ] You should establish size and allocate memory for the data items.
       This should probably be done during the third pass (DT_ZTSTR will
       not be known until it is read).
   [ ] The current RuleSet return by ParseBPFFile() is empty. The PPs are
       not inserted into the list.
   [ ] Create a separate todo list for strlib. This will be portable to
       other projects - an "inline object".
   [ ] Fill out all the empty function paramater comment blocks.
   [ ] Write the struct mini-comment blocks.
   [_] Create file parser for .bpf (bin parse format) files.
   [ ] Put names in about().
   [ ] Remove version string from help().
   [ ] Write man pages for bp(1) and bpf(5).
   [ ] Need to properly differentiate between ' and " in the strlib.
   [ ] Test strlib.c::mid_trunc(). It looks like a weak implementation.
   [ ] Move strlib code headers to .h file (not in .c file!).
   [ ] Write actual options parsing code (instead of stubing defaults).
   [ ] How do you handle exceptions in strlib.c::mid_trunc()?
  Done:
   [X] Document the BPF file format somewhere - at least in text. Perhaps
       write a mBNF ruleset for the file.
   [X] Decide if enum tags can have collisions (with builtins). Decide if
       builtin enums will be supported.
   [X] Put this string into the test framework.
   [W] Rename the binary directory to "bp". WITHDRAWN: The repo is "binparse"
       so, there you go.
   [X] Doh! You never wrote the code to parse an "enum list". That has the
       following syntax (for a 1-byte boolean):
	    { 0 = "no"; default = "yes" }
       This is the point of the EnumList and EnumPair structs at the top of
	    bpfparse.h.
   [X] The lineno is not set.
   [X] The ParsePoint list needs to have a 2nd-pass "compile".
   [X] Establish primary data structures.
   [X] Perhaps it should be bp (bin parse) rather than bd (bin dump).
   [X] Start a strlib (String Library).
   [X] Setup options.h definitions (what we will support).
