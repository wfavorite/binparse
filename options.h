#ifndef OPTIONS_H
#define OPTIONS_H

/* I am making a design decision here.
   It is primarily about effeciency in the development effort, and how much
   time should be spent chasing more expensive and esoteric features. The
   general rule I have is - If it takes longer to explain than code, then
   just code it. Here I choose to explain.

   The problem is two-fold:

   1. Options parsed in the file *override* those on the command line. This
      is generally inconsistent with how this nomrally works.

   2. You cannot pass command line options when using interpreter magic
      because the <unistd> getopt() will not allow parsing flags after
      strings. (The magic approach leaves the args as follows: arg0 is the
      binary (bp), arg1 is the executable text file with the magic in the
      header, argN are the options you pass after the invocation of the
      magic'd file.)

   The fix is brutal and efficient:

   When you are using a magic file, pass options by the file. When you are
   using the command line, use command line options, and be aware of any 
   setopt options in the file.

   Why?:

   Because it is much easier to code. What would have been required to solve
   these problems:

   1. Parse all command line options, save the values to a staging area.
      Parse all file options (using the file supplied on the command line).
      Apply file options. Apply command line options.

   2. Ditch getopt() (Somthing that I have traditionally been in favor of.),
      and write your own parsing code that does not care about order (except
      for the ordering of the filename strings).

   If I see some acceptance of the tool, perhaps I will invest in this area.
   Until then, I would rather invest the coding time in areas will more
   impact on the usability of the product.
